Normalization steps:
--
1 Normal Form: Our logical design was already in the first normal form because there are no groups of duplicative data in the tables.

2 Normal Form: Each table's columns only depend on the primary key of that table, and we have foreign keys for table relationships.
 
3 Normal Form: Each table's colomns only depend on the primary key of that table. 

Boyce-Codd: All tables are decomposed into separate tables where there are no longer any composite keys. 

Our logical design in Boye-Codd Normal form:
